## Get Started
1. Please download the dataset you need at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l51QsKvQPcqILT3DwfjCgx8Dsg2rpjot/view?usp=drive_link) or [Baidu Cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/11AWXg1Z6UwjHzmto4hesAA?pwd=9qjr).

2. Note the position you place the dataset package and modify the path in `scripts` files accordingly.

3. Change to the correct path, then use bash to run the specific script file, e.g., `bash ./scripts/traffic.sh`.

## Acknowledgment
> 1. We recognize that this is an imperfect work. Please let us know if you have any questions or suggestions about the code or specific techniques in the paper.
> 2. It is recommended to **increase the length of compression parameters** when using ***short look-back windows***, other hyperparameters should also be adjusted accordingly.  
> 3. Please consider starring this repository and citing our research if you find the paper interesting or this repo helpful.
